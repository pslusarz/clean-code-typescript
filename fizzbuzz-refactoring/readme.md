Fizzbuzz is a game alementary students play when learning division. Given a number, fizzbuzz outputs:
- "fizz" if the number is divisible by 3
- "buzz" if the number is divisible by 5
- "fizzbuzz" if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5
- the number itself if neither of the above applies

## Legacy code

You have inherited the following code. 

- Refactor it to separate the output mechanism from the algorithm.
- Refactor the tests
- Which of the SOLID principles were violated in the original code?
- How does the refactored code compare to the original?
